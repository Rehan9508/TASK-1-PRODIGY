Explanation of the Code Project:
This project analyzes population data of various countries over different years. It employs Python with popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Here's a detailed breakdown of the tasks performed in the code:

1. Importing Libraries
numpy and pandas: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn: For creating visualizations.
2. Loading and Exploring Data
The population dataset (Data Bank.csv) is loaded using pd.read_csv().
data.head(): Displays the first 5 rows to get an overview of the dataset.
data.shape: Reveals the number of rows and columns in the dataset.
data.dtypes, data.info(), data.describe(): Provide insights into the dataset's structure, data types, and statistical summaries.
3. Visualization for the Year 2022
Objective: Display the top 50 countries with the highest population for the year 2022.
The dataset is filtered to include Country Name and the population for the year 2022.
Rows are sorted in descending order based on the population.
The top 50 countries are selected using head(50).
A horizontal bar chart is created using Seaborn's barplot(), where:
X-axis: Population in 2022.
Y-axis: Country names.
plt.title(), plt.xlabel(), plt.ylabel(): Add a title and axis labels to enhance the plot's readability.
4. Comparison Between 2010 and 2020
Objective: Analyze the relationship between populations in 2010 and 2020.
The dataset is filtered to include Country Name, 2010, and 2020 population columns.
A scatter plot with a regression line is created using Seaborn's regplot():
X-axis: Population in 2010.
Y-axis: Population in 2020.
A red regression line (trend line) shows the general relationship between the two variables.
plt.title(), plt.xlabel(), plt.ylabel(): Add a title and axis labels to clarify the plot's purpose.
Purpose of the Project
Visualizing Population Trends:

The bar chart highlights the countries with the largest populations in 2022.
Useful for comparing population sizes and understanding global distribution.
Analyzing Population Growth:

The scatter plot compares population sizes in 2010 and 2020.
The regression line identifies trends, such as proportional growth or anomalies.
Applications
Policy Making: Helps governments or organizations in resource allocation based on population trends.
Business Decisions: Useful for market analysis and identifying target regions.
Educational Insight: Offers insights into global population dynamics.
